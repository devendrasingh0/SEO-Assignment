A favicon, also known as a website icon or shortcut icon, is a small image that is associated with a website or web page. It is typically displayed in the browser tab next to the page title, and it can also be used in the browser's bookmark list and other places.

Favicons are typically small square images, such as 16x16 or 32x32 pixels. They can be in any image format, such as PNG, GIF, or ICO. However, ICO is the preferred format for favicons, as it is the most widely supported.

To create a favicon, you can use any image editing software. Once you have created your favicon, you need to upload it to the root directory of your website. Once the favicon is uploaded, it will be automatically displayed in the browser tab next to the page title.
